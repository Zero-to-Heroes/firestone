TODO:

=============
Ready for constructed overlay
==============

- Add "open logs folder" button in system tray
- Auto Updater
- settings
- on first startup, the overlay isn't correctly sized
- validate that logged in user is premium / get their premium status

- BG overlay
    - Hero stats overlay
    - board highlight seems off
- update builder / overlay tech
- disk cache on overlay window

- injector: make instantiation lazy
- notifications (component and service, which relies on OW)
- mercenaries widgets (move store to shared module, like game-state)
- basically everything linked to the old store - remove it completely
- resize window
- all the rest (prefs, settings, main windows, etc)
- indexeddb service (in settings-root.component)
- load user-defined language in electron-setup, instead of the default one
