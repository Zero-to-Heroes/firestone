We're opening a beta-tester program! If you're interested in helping Firestone development by reporting issues on the next versions (and having exclusive sneak peaks of what's ahead), just let me know [on Discord](https://discord.gg/vKeB3gnKTy).

# How to become a beta tester

- (You don't need to uninstall your current version before installing the beta version)
- Install the version from https://download.overwolf.com/install/Download?ExtensionId=lnknbakkpommmjjdnelmfbjjdbocfpnpbkijjnob&app_channel=beta. This will let you benefit from auto-updates for beta builds.
- (Optional) Go to [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/vKeB3gnKTy) and react to the [appropriate message on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/187101197767933952/718113027244818543/799283504490741771) to get notifications when new beta versions are out

# What being a beta-tester means

- You will have a specific role on the Discord, and be notified on updates to the beta-tester channel
- Please provide feedback on the private Discord channel when you encounter bugs, or things that don't work as you expect, or basically anything you think could improve the overall app
- The beta version of the app is usually stable, but it's possible that some bugs creep in from time to time.
