We're opening a beta-tester program! If you're interested in helping Firestone development by reporting issues on the next versions (and having exclusive sneak peaks of what's ahead), just let me know [on Discord](https://discord.gg/FhEHn8w).

# How to become a beta tester

Just ping me (@sebastientromp) [on Discord](https://discord.gg/FhEHn8w).

# What being a beta-tester means

- You will have a specific role on the Discord, and access to a private beta-tester channel
- You will have the opportunity to manually install new Firestone releases before they are officially up
- Please provide feedback on the private Discord channel when you encounter bugs, or things that don't work as you expect, or basically anything you think could improve the overall app

# How to install new releases

- Uninstall your current version first. If you want to keep your stats, first make sure that you have created an account, are logged in (look at the icon at the bottom left of the main window), and have played at least one match since you logged in.
- Install the version from https://download.overwolf.com/install/Download?ExtensionId=lnknbakkpommmjjdnelmfbjjdbocfpnpbkijjnob&app_channel=beta. This will let you benefit from auto-updates for beta builds.
- (Optional) React to the [appropriate message on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/187101197767933952/718113027244818543/799283504490741771) to get notifications when new beta versions are out
