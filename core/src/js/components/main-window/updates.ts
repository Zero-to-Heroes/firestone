					This release has some moderate logging enabled to try and help me debug some issues that seem to arise randomly: Reckoning being greyed out inappropriately, and the tavern timing turn in BG being off by 1 in the future. <br/>
					So if you encounter one of these issues, by all mean please open a bug report! :) <br/>
					You might therefore face some lags (mostly in BG), but overall I think things should be fine. <br/>
					<br/>
					Have fun, and thanks again for all the help :)
