## CRITICAL ERROR: Could not load the cards database

-   Check if you can access https://static.firestoneapp.com/data/cards/cards_enUS.gz.json from Chrome
-   If not, this means that there is an issue with your router / ISP / VPN that blocks access to AWS. Parental control is also known cause for this issue.
    -   Antivirus softwares can sometimes block the access, try turning it off
    -   IMPORTANT: this seems to be a more a more prevalent cause of issue recently, so please check your parental control settings (also with your ISP), and whitelist https://static.zerotoheroes.com and https://static.firestoneapp.com
-   If nothing helps, email me at support@firestoneapp.com

### Other things to try

-   Someone managed to fix the issue by hard killing Overwolf from the task manager, closing Hearthstone, and restarting Overwolf
