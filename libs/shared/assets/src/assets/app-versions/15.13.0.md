## Arena

-   ✨ When inspecting a Legendary card during the draft, the app now shows you the stats of all its entourage cards
-   ✨ The Card Stats tab in the app now also show stats for cards that can be discovered but can't be drafted
-   ✨ Dynamic pools (the list of cards a specific card can discover) should now better work with Arena
-   🐞 Fix an issue where an incorrect deck list could show up after redrafting in Underground
-   🐞 Fix some stat issues
-   🐞 Improve detection of cards picked, which should fix a few issues where some picks are not correctly registered
    -   There is still an "issue" where the first three picks in a draft will appear empty because the legendary + entourage cards are picked at the same time

## Battlegrounds

-   🐞 Fix an issue where the tribes list could be empty in the cards list widget

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Show "elementals last turn" counter when discovering / having Stone Sentinel
-   ✨ Add highlights (Imprisoned Scrap Imp, Netherspite Historian, Steon Sentinel, Razorfen Beastmaster, Captain's Parrot, Ichor of Undeath, Harmonic Metal)
-   ✨ Add/fix related cards (Ichor of Undeath)
