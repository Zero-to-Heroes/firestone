## Decktracker

-   ✨ Mousing over the "forged" symbol in the opponent's hand shows a list of possible cards
    -   It uses the current format and the current known card classes in your deck
    -   This tech will be extended to other types of hints in the future
-   ✨ When mousing over a card drawn by Robocaller in the opponent's hand, you now see a box with informations about the cost of that card
    -   Similarly, this tech will be extended to give you more info about the cards in the opponent's hand
-   🐞 Fix an issue where unlaunched Starships would count towards the total attack on board
-   🐞 Fix an issue where some Treants would not increase the "Treants summoned" counter
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Adaptative Amalgam would not properly appear as a possible target to spells like Raise Dead (because it was shuffled back in the deck)
-   🐞 Fix a few weird shennanigans with Zilliax
-   🐞 Fix an issue where cards destroyed by Patchwerk would miss their cost in the opponent's decklist
-   🐞 Fix an info leak when the opponent dredges (the card they dredged would be revealed in their deck)
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the coin you get at the start would not be properly considered as "not part of your initial deck" for cards like Grand Magister Rommath

## Battlegrounds
