## Decktracker

-   ✨ Activating the Streamer Mode in Firestone now hides the opponent's name in the decktracker.
-   ✨ Add many oracles and card highlights. These are usually not written in the release notes anymore, but I just wanted to mention it so you know that these are continually being improved on :slight_smile:
-   ✨ Move the format info of the mulligan deck overview (standard/wild/twist) to a second line to reduce the horizontal space taken by the widget.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where some cards created in deck would not be flagged as gifts when drawn by the opponent.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the mana cost of cards transformed in hand (like Shifter Zerus) would not be properly updated.

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ There is now an option to always show Tier 7 minions in the minions list.
-   ✨ The minion stats should now appear on top of the overlays (like Divine Shield, Stealth, etc.) when viewing replays so that they are clearly visible at all times.
-   🐞 Fix many simulation issues. I still expect a few releases over the week to get to pre-patch level of accuracy, but the odds should be decently reliable at the moment. Note: one of difficulties with having full accuracy is that Hearthstone itself has a few bugs; so the simulation can be accurate, but the game itself can still be wrong, which results in incorrect odds.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where some buddies would not appear in the buddies list.
-   🐞 (Premium) Fix some live stats being incorrectly computed while in game ("coins wasted" and "enemy heroes killed" mainly).

## Collection

-   🐞 Fix an issue where the count of Diamond / Signature cards would not appear when browsing the collection.
