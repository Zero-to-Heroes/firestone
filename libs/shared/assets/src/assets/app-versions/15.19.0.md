## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ First version of the Compositions Stats tab in the app! Look up which comps perform best at each rank
    -   The "Power" stat is my take on trying to assign a numerical value to how strong compositions are. More details at https://github.com/Zero-to-Heroes/firestone/wiki/Battlegrounds-Compositions-Power-stat
    -   Let me know if you see some oddities!
-   ✨ Perfect games now also list the comp type, and lets you filter to only include games with that comp
-   ✨ Compositions have been updated to more accurately reflect the current meta
    -   Comps are provided by Slyders, who got multiple #1 finishes on the leaderboard

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Update highlights (Shadowcloth Needle, Spelunker, Imp King Rafaam, The Galactic Projection Orb)
    -   Add a "reverse kindred" highlight: when mousing over a card with a tribe / spell school, it will highlight Kindred cards with that tribe / spell school
    -   Cards created by Blasteroid are tagged as fire spells, and so will be highlighted by Living Flame
