## Decktracker

-   ✨ The Dragons Summoned counter now shows up for the opponent when they're playing Druid (it used to show up only for Priest).
-   🐞 Fix an issue where card traded back in your opponent deck would sometimes incorrectly increment their count in deck (mostly when importing a decklist for your opponent).
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the Secrets Helper would not show the list of secrets when created by certain cards (e.g. Desperate Measures, Oh My Yogg).
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Zilliax would appear as a 0-cost card in the meta decks lists.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the mulligan helper would not show any data for Zilliax.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Whizbang decks would not be properly imported for the opponent.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where selecting multiple decks in the Constructed tab would only show stats for the first selected deck.

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ You can now browse the Duos leaderboards from the Battlegrounds section. The MMR of your opponent displayed in the lobby (if activated) now use this new Duos leaderboard.
-   🐞 Fix (again) some issues with Duos. A previous update accidentally overwrote some of the fixes that were made for Duos, and this update should restore them.
-   🐞 Fix multiple simulation issues.

## Replays

-   🐞 Top 4 now shows up as a loss in Duos.

## Collection

-   🐞 Fix the behavior of the "back" button.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where clicking on a card to see the details would sometimes not show anything.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where card sound effects had disappeared.
-   🐞 (Premium) Fix an issue where collection stats would always show the info for the whole collection, instead of matching the selected sets (mostly Standard / Wild).
