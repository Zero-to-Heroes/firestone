## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ Add a "Personal stats" tab for Battlegrounds
    -   You can show the stats by hero, or by trinket
    -   You will need to clear your local cache (from the Settings > General > Data), and possibly also refresh your games data (from the same screen) if you want to load your all-time data

## Constructed

-   ✨ You can now view your Brawl decks in the My Decks stats by changing the "Format" filter
    -   This is a bit barebone to let you see stats for your Brawl decks, but should do the job for now :)
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Scenic Vista would stop remembering cards after Mistah Vistah died
