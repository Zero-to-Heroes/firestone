## Decktracker

-   ✨ Premium users can now move directly over cards in their hand to highlight related cards in the deck tracker (non-premium users can still do this by mousing over the cards in hand in the tracker itself).
-   ✨ Unknown Mixed Concoctions in the opponent's hand are now flagged! As this card is a custom card (thanks Matt!), it is not localized and will always be in English for now.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Energy Shaper would leak some information about what cards in the opponent's hand were spells.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Counterspell cards' effect would not be properly accounted for when graying out some secrets in the secrets helper.

## Battlegrounds

-   🐞 Fix a sim issue where Rapid Reanimation's target would not always be correct.
-   🐞 Fix a sim issue where Weebomination's battlecry was not implemented.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the Warband Stats chart would not properly display numbers greater than 1000.
