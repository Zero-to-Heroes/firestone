## Decktracker

-   ✨ The mulligan guide overlay has been revamped! It has more data, is presented in a clearer way, and lets you customize what kind of data it uses. You can choose the target Rank Bracket (Legend, Top 2k Legend, Diamond-Legend), whether to get the data vs All Classes or your current opponent's class (mostly useful when the sample size is low). And you can sort the cards based on Impact or Keep rate. Also, it has colors!
-   ✨ Your opponent's decklist is now automatically imported in Twist.
-   ✨ Fizzle's Snapshot will now remember cards as your opponent plays them (if they were in their hand when the Snapshot was created).
-   ✨ Add card highlights for Twist passives.
-   ✨ Twist passives are now added to the Global Effects section.
-   ✨ Jace Darkweaver now shows all the spells it will replay as related cards on mouse over.
-   ✨ Update the order of cards in hand for Hearth Stonebrew's hands.

## Arena

-   ✨ The mulligan guide overlay has also been updated! See the section above for all the details (except you currently can't change any filter).
-   ✨ The secrets helper now uses a different card pool for secrets that were part of the initial deck and secrets that were generated by other cards.

## General

-   🐞 Fix a long-standing issue where the app would sometimes behave strangely if (re)started while a game was in progress. This was mostly visible in BG, but it would affect all game modes.

## Battlegrounds

-   🐞 Fix an issue where the "extra gold next turn" counter would still use some old values.
-   ✨ The "extra gold next turn" counter should stop updating while in combat.
