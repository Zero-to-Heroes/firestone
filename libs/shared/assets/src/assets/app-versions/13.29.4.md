## App

-   ✨ The logs parser is now about 4x faster, which means it should use much less CPU while playing. This should be especially visible when playing Battlegrounds

## Constructed

-   🐞 Fix an issue when merging two decks that both had several versions
-   There has been a technical update to how mulligan stats are retrieved. This should not have any impact on you, but please be aware that it might cause a few hiccups during the first few days

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ App has been updated for 30.6.
    -   The simulator has undergone a pretty big refactor in how it handles Start of Combat effects (because of the new Promo Portrait).
    -   As such, it's possible that simulations will be off for a couple of days while I figure everything out
-   ✨ Trinkets now showcase tips from both RDU (streamer and former leaderboard #1) and Minder (also a former leaderboard #1)
-   ✨ Increased the resolution of screenshots being taken from the "Battles" tab
-   ✨ Add a setting to always show Buddies in the minions list
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Pilgrimp would appear in both tier 4 and tier 5 sections
-   🐞 Fix an issue where hero stats could take a long time to show up on game start

## Twitch

-   ✨ Add a notification when the Twitch token is expired, requiring you to login again

## Replays

-   🐞 Fix an issue where replays wouldn't be loaded in some cases
