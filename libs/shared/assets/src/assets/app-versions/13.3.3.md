## Arena

-   ✨ Card stats now have more info about pick rate, including pick rate for runs that went to 6+ wins. Please be aware that it might take a few days to gather enough data to have reliable stats.
-   ✨ Premium users can now see the pickrate of each card directly on the overlay.
-   ✨ If you run HearthArena at the same time as Firestone and are not a premium user, the "go premium" banner that appears below the draft (if you have the "show draft stat" setting turned on) will now move to the side.

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ Add a Blood Gem counter (even though you can see the current Blood Gem buff while mousing over a minion with the Blood Gem keyword, it's often not practical).
-   🐞 Fix a sim issue where Venomstrike Trap and Snake Trap could trigger on a full board.
-   🐞 Fix a sim issue where minions that were reborn could attack out of order.
-   🐞 Fix a sim issue where Broodmother's Onyxian Whelp would mess up the attack order after attacking immediately.
-   🐞 Fix a sim issue where Embrace Your Rage would not be properly accounted for if another Start of Combat hero power triggered before it.
-   🐞 Fix a sim issue where Stormpike Lieutenant would buff the board, instead of the tavern.

## Decktracker

-   🐞 Fix an issue where the same secret could appear multiple times in the secrets tracker.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where card highlights in the tracker would persist after picking a Discover option that would highlight cards.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the tracker would not appear when starting the app while already in a match.
