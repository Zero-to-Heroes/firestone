## Decktracker

- ✨ Improve card guesses for linked cards
    - For instance, when a card is copied by Rangari Scout and revealed later, the copy will be revealed
- ✨ Update the card tooltip display when there is some additional info to show
    - The additional info will show at the top, and below it you'll see the card pool (if there is one)
- ✨ Update the card tooltip to close when clicking on it
    - The "close by pressing q" was not really user-friendly, so let me know if this feels better
- ✨ Leaving the mouse over a card name in the tracker will make its name scroll if it's too long to fit
- ✨ Update global effects (Turbulus, Master Dusk)
- ✨ Update oracles (Lie in Wait, Way of the Shell)
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Jar Dealer)
- ✨ Update highlights (Starcraft cards)
- 🐞 Fix an issue where Rewinds could cause the tracker to become incorrect
    - This was a caused by a regression from an earlier patch, sorry about that
- 🐞 Fix an issue where Gorgonzormu's Delicious Cheese dynamic pool would not appear
- 🐞 Fix an issue where some Fabled cards would not disappear from the deck when drawn (e.g. Bwonsamdi when drawn by Talanji)
- 🐞 Fix an issue where an empty "additional info" box would sometimes appear when mousing over cards in the opponent's hand
- 🐞 Fix an issue where card tooltips would sometimes go out of the screen's bounds

## Constructed

- 🐞 Fix an issue where the lobby tracker would sometimes not show a deck' stats
