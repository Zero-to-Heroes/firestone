## Premium

- Pricing has been slightly reworked for premium subscriptions:
    - You can now subscribe for a six-months duration, with the same discount as the previous yearly plan, as I understand that some people were a big reluctant about subbing for a full year
    - The discount for the yearly plan has been increased, to reward even more long-term subscribers!
- Reminder that subscribing to Firestone Premium gives you premium features for ALL game modes - you don't need different premium subscriptions for Constructed, Battlegrounds or Arena

## Battlegrounds

- ✨ Add an APM (actions per minute) counter. See how fast you can go when playing some high intensity compositions!
- ✨ (Premium) Auto-highlight The Coin when Wizened Captain is on your board
- 🐞 Fix an issue where minion pins (on the shop) and highlights (in the Comps view) would not correctly handle golden minions
- 🐞 Fix an issue where a hero linked to a specific tribe (like Millificent Manastorm) could appear in the tier list even when that tribe isn't in the lobby

## Decktracker

- ✨ Add an option to sort the cards in the Hand zone by their order in hand, instead of mana cost

- ✨ The Anachronos counter will now show the minions that will come back once the two turns are over
- ✨ Improved how the Secrets Helper filters out possible secrets when they are created by discovering cards
    - For instance, if the secret played was created by Rewind, the Secrets Helper only shows you secrets that the opponent has already played this game
- ✨ Improved filtering of possible cards in the opponent's hand
    - Similarly, if you mouse over the "created by Rewind" icon in the opponent's hand, the tooltip will show you the list of cards that were played this game
- ✨ Add a "friendly undead since last turn" counter that appears when discovering relevant cards
    - It only appears during discovers, as otherwise the game already shows you when the effect will trigger
- ✨ Show "cards played this game that didn't start in your deck" counter for Techysaurus
- ✨ Update highlights (Dinner Performer, Wither, Rimescale Siren, Felscale Evoker, Rewind, Instrument Smasher, Rock Master Voone, Scuttlebutt Ghoul, Mosh Pit, Invincible, Glaivetar, Flustered Librarian, Bonecaller, Rewind, Totemic Evidence)

- ✨ Add oracle (Ritual of Life, Primal Sabretooth)
- ✨ Add an Eliza Goreblade counter
    - She has been moved out of the global effects to better keep track of how many times her deathrattle triggered
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the menagerie counter could sometimes give you incorrect information
    - It also improves how it displays the types of minions you have played this game, to give you more information about dual tribe minions
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the opponent's Tidepool Pupil would not tracker secrets

- 🐞 Fix an issue where a shuffle Adaptive Amalgam was marked as "created by"
- 🐞 Fix an issue where a Zilliax discarded by the opponent would have a cost of 0

## Arena

    - This lets you see the dynamic pool of cards more easily
    - And of course, you can turn that off from the settings
- ✨ When viewing the first legendary pick, it will also show you all the package cards
- ✨ Add a first version of "reverse synergies" during the draft
    - For instance, mousing over a spell will now highlight Tidepool Pupil, because it's a card that cares about spells
