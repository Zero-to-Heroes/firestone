## Settings

The Settings have been fully revamped!

-   ✨ New layout, to make it easier to browse (for you) and maintain (for me)
-   ✨ Added a search function, which will narrow the shown settings. This should help with one of the biggest issues of the app: settings discovery
-   ✨ I've also reorganized a little bit how some sections are structured. Let me know if you think some still don't make much sense
