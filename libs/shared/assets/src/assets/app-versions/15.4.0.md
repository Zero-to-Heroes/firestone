## Arena

-   ✨ Add a "Season recap" widget that lets you see at a glance how you're doing in the current Arena season
    -   While this is mostly useful for Streamers to share their progress with their audience, I find it's pretty nice to have a recap of your latest runs always visible on-screen
    -   You can also change the timeframe to include all your Arena runs

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Secrets created by Sweetened Snowflurry are now restricted to be Frost secrets in the Secrets helper
-   ✨ Add a counter for Fly Off the Shelves, that shows you the damage the card will do
-   ✨ Add card highlights (Capture Coldtooth Mine, Menagerie Jug)
-   ✨ Add oracles (Libram of Clarity)
-   🐞 Fix an issue where cards put to the Top of the Deck by Dark Gifts who have a cost of 0
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the "lobby tracker" (that shows you the decklist before going into a game) would not display the deck's stats correctly in some cases
