## Guilds

-   ✨ A very first version of the Guilds feature is now available! They will allow you to share all kinds of Hearthstone-related things with your friends or communities. This first version adds a shared leaderboard for all game modes, and more features are planned for the future (let me know what you'd like to see!). Please note that guild creation is not yet publicly available and is currently reserved for streamers who contact me directly on Discord. The goal is to first see what features click with the community and then open it up to everyone.

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Flint Firearm now shows all Quickdraw cards you can get on mouse over. This new piece of tech will let me display dynamic card pools for other cards, so let me know which ones you'd like to see!
-   ✨ Cards received from Repackaged Box are now flagged in hand.
-   ✨ Add the new opponent decks in Twist.
-   🐞 Fix an issue that would show incorrect cards as being in your opponent's deck when using the Legacy Tracker mode.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where secrets replayed by Tess (and probably Yogg) would not be flagged as gifts.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where some cards like Tess would show incorrect information after playing a hero card and changing classes.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where some card tooltips would suddenly become empty.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where card highlight for Lady Liadrin would also include spells played on non-friendly characters.

## Battlegrounds

-   🐞 Only show Disguised Graverobber in the minions list when Undead are in.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the opponent's boards were not always properly detected when facing the ghosts in Duos.
-   🐞 Fix multiple simulation issues.

## Arena

-   🐞 Fix an issue where a lot of match-related data points were missing from the card stats, like mulligan winrate.
