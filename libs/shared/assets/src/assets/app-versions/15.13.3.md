Third release this week! Don't forget to check the release notes for the last couple of releases if you haven't yet.

## Arena

-   ‚ú® Dynamic pools will now use the list of cards that can be discovered in game (which is a bit different from the list of cards that can be drafted).
    -   It will probably require a few days for the pool to be fully up-to-date
-   ‚ú® Add an option to show the additional card stats (pick rate / deck impact) only when deciding which cards to remove from your deck
    -   It can be activated from the Settings, under Arena > General

## Decktracker

-   ‚ú® Add dynamic pool (N'Zoth the Corruptor, N'Zoth God of the Deep, Cobalt Spellkin, Hadronox, Endbringer Umbra, Infantry Reanimator)
-   ‚ú® Add highlights (Yogg-Saron Master of Fate, Hamuul Runetotem, Hadronox, Endbringer Umbra, Infantry Reanimator)
-   üêû Fix an issue where Tidepool Pupil would not show up the spells it could create anymore

## App

-   ‚ú® You can now synchronize your card collection to https://www.hsguru.com !
    -   You need to activate that from the settings (under Integrations > Third party)
    -   HSGuru will probably need a few more days to implement the feature on their side, so don't panic if you don't see anything on the website yet :)
-   ‚ú® Add an option to get a Windows toast notification when it's your turn to play
    -   You can activate this from the Settings, under Accessibility
    -   You can also combine this with the "flash window" option

## Mercs

-   üêû Fix an issue where the app's Mercenaries window would always show an empty collection
