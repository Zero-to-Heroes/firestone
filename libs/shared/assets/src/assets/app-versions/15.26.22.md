    - Improve weapon highlights to include cards that equip a weapon
    - Fix an issue with Kindred highlights for the ALL tribe minions
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Synthesize, Crystal Broker, Rest in Peace, Containment Unit, Raylla Sand Sculptor, Zarog's Crown, Peaceful Piper, Habeas Corpses, Jungle Jammer)
    - Scrappy Scavenger now remembers how much mana was available after you played it, to always show the relevant dynamic card pool
    - Mousing over Murloc Holmes will now show the opponent's starting hand

## Arena
