## Tavern Brawl

- ✨ Added a way to see the current meta decks in more details
    - This is still a work in progress, mostly because there is no archetyping for meta decks yet so it's a bit difficult to navigate
- ✨ Add a button to easily copy the deck code from the meta page
- ✨ Added a way to see your personal brawl decks easily from the Decks tab
- ✨ Dynamic card pools will now try to use more specific card pools for brawls

## Constructed

- ✨ Add a button to easily copy the deck code from the meta decks page
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Jungle Jammer)
- ✨ Update highlights (Relics, Nightmare Fuel, Part Scrapper, Twisted Tether, Twilight Influence)
    - Add support for the "gives armor" highlight, for cards like Shield Slam
- 🐞 Fix an issue where Standard Casual games would not appear in the My Decks section when filtering for Casual
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the lobby tracker would sometimes not resize correctly

## Decktracker

- ✨ Add a Pirates Summoned counter
- ✨ Mark cards fed to the Underfel Rift as "burned"

## Battlegrounds

- ✨ Add an option to let Streamers display the current anomaly as a big card on their screen
- 🐞 Continue improving the accuracy of the simulator. Accuracy should be high at this point, and new fixes will mostly concern edge cases
    - There are still issues simulating Silent Enforcer + Titus, so this specific board state can lead to some incorrect outcomes
