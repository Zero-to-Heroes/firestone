## Settings

The Settings have been fully revamped!

-   ✨ New layout, to make it easier to browse (for you) and maintain (for me)
-   ✨ Added a search function, which will narrow the shown settings. This should help with one of the biggest issues of the app: settings discovery
-   ✨ I've also reorganized a little bit how some sections are structured. Let me know if you think some still don't make much sense
-   NOTE: if you're searching for something, but the search bar doesn't return what you're looking for, please let me know (Discord or bug report) with the exact search string you were using

## Decktracker

-   🐞 Fix an issue where drawing Zilliax would reset its cost to 0
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Animate Dead would highlight minions with a cost <= 2 (instead of 3)

## Battlegrounds

-   🐞 Fix an issue where neutral minions attached to a tribe (like Wrath Weaver) were not taken into account when telling you whether you were elligible for some trinkets
-   Internal updates on how heroes / trinkets tips are handled. There should be no change for you, but let me know if you come across issues!
