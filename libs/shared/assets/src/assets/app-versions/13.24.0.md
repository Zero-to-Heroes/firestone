## Battlegrounds

-   ‚ú® Thanks to RDU (who you can [watch on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rdulive) for more insights), you can now access tips for each trinket directly in the minions list. This has shown me a few strategies I was not aware of, and I hope they will help you as well :)
-   ‚ú® Premium users can see these tips directly in the overlay, as each option is being offered. Free users can use this twice per day (same as the overlay stats).

## Battlegrounds Simulator

-   üêû Fix an issue where clicking on "Reset" in the simulator UI would clear both boards, instead of reverting the battle to its initial state.
-   ‚ú® Added a "Clear" button to completely clear both boards.

## Decktracker

-   ‚ú® Add a "Discovery" zone in the tracker that shows the cards being offered as Discover options. This will make it easier to view related cards and synergies highlights in your deck
    -   ‚ú® And most notably, when playing Dreamplanner Zephrys, you will be able to see all the cards that you can get from picking each option
    -   You can of course turn that new zone off from the Settings
-   ‚ú® When playing Envoy of Prosperity, the card at the top of your deck will properly appear in a "Top of deck" section
