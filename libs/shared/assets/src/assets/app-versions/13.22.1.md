## Battlegrounds simulator

-   üêû Fix a few additional simulation issues
    -   Please note that there are a few bugs **in HS itself** that cause the simulation to give incorrect results; ironically enough, in these cases the simulation is actually correct, but the game itself isn't
    -   There are still some scenarios involving Scallywag that aren't supported properly. It's not completely clear wheteher this is caused by a simulator issue, or by a game bug. Scallywag is complicated.

## App

-   Remove the link to the website, as it is not maintained anymore. I sitll want to build something on the web to expose stats and other profile-related things, but the current approach was not really maintainable for me.
