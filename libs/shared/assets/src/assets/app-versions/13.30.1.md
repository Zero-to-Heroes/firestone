## Decktracker

-   ✨ When Beaststalker Tavish is played via Meastra in Standard/Arena, the Secrets Helper will now display the improved version of the secrets that are currently available in the mode.
-   ✨ Update cost of cards in the tracker after playing Rotten Rodent
-   ✨ Add a "Class" filter in the My Decks section
-   ✨ Going back to the Meta Decks tab should now remember the previous sorting options
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the deckbuilder would not properly account for the new Core Prince Renathal
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Tram Heist would show incorrect information

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ The minions list now uses a 2-step navigation menu
    -   This should let me add more things to the list while keeping the clutter to minimal levels
-   ✨ The simulation should now start a couple of seconds sooner while going into a battle in Solos. Things are unchanged for Duos.
-   🐞 Continue fixing simulation issues
-   🐞 Due to a change in what is sent to the game client, Firestone is unable to tell you how many all-time games you've played with each hero. I'm looking for an alternative solution, but it's possible that this feature will have to be removed in the future.
