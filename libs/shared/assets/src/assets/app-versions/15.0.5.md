## App

-   ‚ú® This version starts to introduce a new subscription provider, in addition to the current Overwolf subscription system. This is pretty important for me, as it will let me do a few things that weren't possible until now:
    -   Annual plans, with discounts
    -   A verified Discord role (the current Supporter role is self-assigned, and unfortunately is abused by some who are not premium subscribers)
    -   The ability to have discount codes
    -   And further down the line, many more options that aren't possible today with the current subscription system
-   You can now manage your plans fully from the app, by clicking on the "premium" icon at the bottom left of the app's main window
-   To celebrate this, you can use a discount count directly from the app that will give you an additional discount on the already-discounted yearly plan.
    -   The code is available on the Premium page, and should be available for around a month or so

## Arena

-   ‚ú® You can now see runs being drafted in your "My Runs" tab, with their current run score.
    -   Going into the Deck Details also give you the current picks in real time
-   ‚ú® Going to the My Stats tab will now show Rewards stats as well
    -   Keep in mind that there were some issues with rewards detection in the past, so it might only include rewards from new runs played onwards
-   üêû Fix an issue where some picks where sometimes not registered properly
-   üêû Fix an issue where rewards were sometimes not saved

## Tracker

-   ‚ú® Mousing over cards in your hand (in the game itself) now triggers card highlights for everyone (it used to be a premium-exclusive feature)
    -   This can of course be turned off from the settings
-   ‚ú® Add a new widget to show which starships your opponent has launched
    -   It is activated by default
    -   It shows up if your opponent has one of Jim Raynor's classes (Paladin, Shaman, Warrior) and has launched at least one starship
-   ‚ú® In the tracker, "Unknown card"s will now include the creator's name, if it exists
-   ‚ú® Add card highlights (The Dark Portal, Rowdy Partner)
-   ‚ú® The Spectral Pillager, Lardy Darkvein and Grey Sage Parrot counter widgets were removed, and you can now access the information simply by mousing over their respective card on the decklist
-   üêû Fix an issue where resizing some widgets (max resources, secrets helper) would not persist between games.
    -   Also fix a flickering when dragging them around after having resized them
-   üêû Fix an issue where Discovering cards with a Dark Gift would not work as expected

## Battlegrounds

-   ‚ú® More color customizations are now available for the Battlegrounds overlay. You can now make the app color scheme more neutral, more fantasist, or however you like!
    -   Please share with me your custom themes, as I'm always excited to see how everyone customizes their app
    -   Let me know if you'd like more customization options

## App (other)

-   ‚ú® Searching in the settings should now be a bit easier, as I've added the ability to attach "keywords" to some settings
    -   For instance, search for "health" or "mana" will now return the Max Resources widget counter
-   üêû Fix an issue where clicking on the "Update" button multiples times in a row would lead to an error
-   üêû Fix an issue where the app would sometimes pop up when leaving another game (like League of Legends)
