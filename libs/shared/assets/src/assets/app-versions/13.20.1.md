## App

-   ‚ú® The app has been updated to version 30.2, including all the new trinkets!

## Battlegrounds

-   ‚ú® Added an option to show all trinkets in the minions list.
-   ‚ú® Mousing over weapon slots on the Twitch extension now allows viewers to see the Greater Trinket (if purchased) or the Lesser Trinket. Full support for trinkets will be added in a future release, but it may take some time.
-   ‚ú® The Battle Simulator now scales better with the app's size. More features, including full support for Duos and Trinkets, will be added in the coming weeks.
-   ‚ú® The "Records Broken" tab has been removed. While it was a fun feature, it wasn't very popular and consumed too many backend resources. Feedback is welcome if you miss it!

## Collection

-   üêû Fixed an issue where Golden Pack pity timers were not correctly updated.
