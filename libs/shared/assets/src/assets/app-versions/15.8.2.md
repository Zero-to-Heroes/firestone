App has been updated for 32.2! As usual, expect updates (mostly to the BG simulator) in the next few days, as new bugs are spotted and fixed.

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add highlights (Felfire Bonfire)
-   ✨ Add an Imbue counter for the opponent (off by default)
-   ✨ Add a counter for Renferal, the Malignant
-   ✨ Add dynamic pools (Toysnatching Geist)
-   ✨ The tracker will now show the "runes" widget in case a Death Knight Tourist was played or in deck
-   🐞 Tentative improvements to remove the delay that appeared in the attack counter and the opponent card markers
    -   These delays were a side-effect of the performance improvements

-   🐞 Fix an issue where deleting decks with multiple versions would only delete the version that was played last

## Arena

-   ✨ Add a mouseover button to view the deck of your last arena runs in the Arena Season recap widget
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the "leadeboard average" stat would include runs that hadn't been started yet
-   🐞 Fix an issue where mousing over Endgame in the draft would not highlight demons
