I'm finally back from vacation! You may have seen multiple updates during that time, which were mostly aimed at fixing issues linked to the latest patches, but I didn't have the time to write proper patch notes.  
You will find below a summary of all the changes that have happened over the past couple of weeks, as well as some brand new stuff :)

## Battlegrounds

- ✨ Quest stats and overlay are back online!
- ✨ Comps have been updated for the latest meta.
    - Thanks to Slyders for his awesome work, as always! You can catch him at https://www.twitch.tv/slyders_hs
- ✨ Comps that require Brann or Titus now properly highlight these cards if you have Moira on board instead
- ✨ You can now filter for all minions with the Rally keyword in the cards list
- 🐞 Many simulation fixes. The simulator is in a decent place at the moment, though not yet at its pre-patch levels
    - The simulator for Duos is apparently still buggy, and I'll look into it this week
- 🐞 Fix the "extra gold next turn" counter
    - Please note that because of the changes made to Hearthstone itself, the counter now doesn't tell you where the extra gold is coming from anymore

## Decktracker

- ✨ Update highlights (Draenei Totemcarver, Treasure Hunter Eudora, Gladesong Siren, Lightmaw Netherdrake, Ravenous Felhunter, Cursed Catacombs, Stranglthorn Heart, Cleanse the Shadow, Corrupt the Light, Untapped Potential, Overlord Saurfang, Raid the Sky Temple, Celestial Shot)
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Palm Reading, Final Frontier, Contraband Stash, Tess, Aegis of Light, Kodo Pack, Shokk, Jettison, Frightened Flunky, Odd Map, Power of Creation, Dwarf Planet, Ferocious Felbat)
    - They should also now correctly take into account some special cases like Starships
    - They should also correctly account for Starcraft cards, and will only show them to you when you have one in your starting deck
- 🐞 There have been an info leak with the Dark Gift counter, which is why it had been disabled. This update now restores it, and makes sure to only count the Gifts that were played by the opponent (your own gifts still show everything)
- 🐞 Fix an issue where Cera'Thine Fleetrunner would incorrectly update the deck contents
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the Protoss minion reduction counter would count Artanis twice
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the opponent's "start of game" effects could lead to having the same card being registered multiple times in their deck
- 🐞 Fix an issue where traded cards would not have cost in the opponent's tracker

## Constructed

- 🐞 Remove the leftover "watch" icon when viewing your own decks as a Premium user. You can now simply click on any replay to load it in the app

## Arena

- ✨ If the latest patch is less than 3 days old, you will now see stats from the last 3 days in the overlay during the draft
    - This avoids the issue where there is not enough data to have meaningful stats, especially if the latest patch didn't have a big impact
- ✨ Small tweaks to the positioning of the hero selection overlay
- 🐞 Tentative fix for incorrect picks detection
    - Please let me know if the app still detects picks incorrectly for you, especially if you're willing to test dev builds to help me resolve the issue once and for all :)
- 🐞 Fix an issue where some cards would sometimes not have stats, either in the card pick overlay or in the decktracker during the draft
- 🐞 Fix personal stats showing incorrect winrates if some games were played without the app running
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the tracker during the draft would not scroll correctly in some cases

## Twitch

- ✨ If you're a streamer, you should now correctly see an error message when your Twitch token is expired
