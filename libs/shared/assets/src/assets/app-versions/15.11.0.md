## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add an option to show all the counters as a compact list, instead of separate widgets across the board
-   ✨ Add a setting to hide the deck mulligan overview when the friends list is open
-   ✨ The global counters opacity setting now also affects the "max resources" widget
-   ✨ Fatigue damage counter now shows the damage from the next fatigue draw
-   ✨ The Naga Giant counter now counts upwards, so that it's aligned on how the other counters work
-   ✨ Add/fix highlights (Trolley Problem, Coldtooth Mine)
    -   Cards that generate Abyssal Curses now highlights other Abyssal Curse generators
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the dynamic pools (the related cards that appear when mousing over a card in the deck) would disappear when the opponent played a card, thus forcing you to mouse over again on the card to see the info
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Bargain Bin would be incorrectly greyed out in the Secrets Helper if the spell was countered

## Battlegrounds
