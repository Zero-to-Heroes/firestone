This version adds a lot of performance improvements while in-game. This should be mostly visible in Battlegrounds, but I hope it will fix the issues that some of you have been getting where widgets would get stuck for a while after the game ends.

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ The "Comps" tab in the minions list is finally back! It brings the most popular builds for the current meta, along with a rough estimation of their power level
    -   Thanks to Slyders, a former #1 leaderboard player and regular top 10 finisher, for putting this together!
-   ✨ Trinket stats overlay is back!
-   ✨ Add a counter for the current Elementals Tavern Buff
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the session widget would sometimes not accomodate all the games being displayed
-   🐞 Continue to improve the accuracy of the battle simulator

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add highlights (Deviate Dreadfang, Power Word: Fortitude, Toad of the Wilds, Barrens Trapper, Fangbound Druid, Primal Dungeoneer, Frostweave Dungeoneer, Devout Dungeoneer, Void Flayer, Dragon Turtle, Veteran Medic, Lightray, Man-at-Arms, Pufferfist, Hookfist-3000, Clutch of Corruption, Bioluminescence, Rune Dagger, Selfless Sidekick, Sorcerous Substitute, Lushwater Scout, Naralex, Shimmering Sunfish)
    -   Fix Imbue cards not highlighting each other
-   ✨ Add dynamic pools (Fyrakk the Blazing)
-   ✨ The secret created by Dreamplanner Zephrys' Extravagant Tour will always be Ice Block in the Secrets Helper
    -   Similar treatment for secrets created by Submerged Spacerock
