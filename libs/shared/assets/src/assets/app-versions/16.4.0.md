## Decktracker

- ✨ Add a "current effecs" section next to the Global Effects
    - Please let me know if some effects should be tracked but arent: the list of tracked effects is maintained manually, to avoid pollution and conflicts with other tracking methods (like the counters)
    - There is an option in the settings to use the enchantment name instead of the card name
- ✨ Improve handling of Broxigar's Start of Game effect
    - It will now mark the other cards from its Fabled package as in the opponent's deck
- ✨ Imported decklists are now preserved after Rewinding the Timeline
- ✨ You can now copy your opponent's partial decklist from the tracker
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Maestra Mask Merchant, Botface, Ressucitate, Relic Miner, Déjà Vu)
- ✨ Update highlights (Giftwrapped Whelp, Twisted Webweaver, Chromie)
- ✨ Update oracles (Violet Spellwing)
    - Flag the card copied by Sketch Artist when the temporary copy is discarded
- 🐞 Tentative fix for an issue where the tracker could give incorrect information when choosing the "Rewind Timeline" option too quickly after playing a Rewind card
    - Logs are doing some really weird things in this case, so there are probably still some issues lingering
- 🐞 Fix an issue where picking "Rewind the Timeline" would be counted as a Discover for the Discover counter
- 🐞 Fix an issue where playing City Chief Esho while not active would still add it to the Global Effects

## Battlegrounds

- ✨ Add an Undead Army counter, that tracks your Undead attack bonus
- ✨ Add a Deep Blues counter
- ✨ Restore the Naga Spell counter
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the Shop Tavern Buff was not working anymore
- 🐞 Fix a couple of small-ish sim issues
    - The simulator is in a good place right now, and should give accurate result
    - The only composition that still requires some work is Silent Enforcer (especially golden) + Lord of the Ruins, especially when Titus is present

## Replays

- ✨ Mousing over the opponent's name in the Replays list will show you their battle tag
    - I want to build something to let you find the tags for your opponents / teammates in Battlegrounds, but this will be more complex UI-wise

## Constructed

- 🐞 Fix an issue where non-collectible cards (like Fabled cards) would be counted towards the dust cost of decks

## Collection

- ✨ The "Best Opened Packs" section is now in its own tab, which lets you browse ALL the packs that you have opened while Firestone was running
