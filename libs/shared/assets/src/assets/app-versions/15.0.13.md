## Decktracker

-   ‚ú® Improved positioning of the counters!
    -   Previously, each counter remembered its own position, which would lead to an endless repositioning depending on what counters you had active
    -   Now, the position is remembered for the index of the counter. Your first counter will always be positioned in the same place, same for your second counter, and so on
    -   IMPORTANT: This means that, initially, your counters won't be where you left them before this update. However, you should now only need to reposition them once
-   ‚ú® Add related card for Ursol's Aura and Return Policy
-   ‚ú® Add counters (Ysondre, Tyrande, Glowroot Lure, Aviana Elune's Chosen)
-   ‚ú® Implement all the new Core cards
-   ‚ú® Zarimi now uses the "Dragons Played" counter instead of the "Dragons Summoned"
-   ‚ú® The Brillant Macaw and Monstrous Parrot counter widgets were removed, and you can now access the information simply by mousing over their respective card on the decklist
-   üêû Fix an issue where some start of combat effects triggering for your opponent would not add the corresponding card to their decklist
