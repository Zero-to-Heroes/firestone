## Arena

-   ‚ú® The app has now full support for The Underground Arena
-   ‚ú® You can filter all stats (hero classes and cards) per game mode
    -   WARNING: early data is corrupted, so there might be some weird things showing up for a day or two
-   ‚ú® Card stats appear while picking your card in either mode AND when redrafting
-   ‚ú® If you click on a Legendary card, it will also show the stats for the three cards in its package
-   ‚ú® The season widget now shows you the stats for the current mode
-   I'm aware that the "run" images are broken for now, and will work on them tomorrow

## Decktracker

-   ‚ú® Added a counter for Flip the Tables for the opponent
    -   It is turned off by default
    -   I understand it's a simple calculation to make, but having it at all time on screen can be helpful when trying to assess the enemy options. Enable at your leasure :)
-   ‚ú® Add an option to show the Max Resources widget horizontally
-   üêû Fix an issue where the opponent's Spell School counter would show up when they hadn't played any spell school
-   üêû Fix an issue where cards added to hand by Sweetened Snowflurry by the opponent could cause the tracker to incorrectly detect some minions on board
