## 对于中国玩家来说 / For Chinese players

-   Tebex（新会员系统的提供商）仍在努力整合支付宝。当支付宝得到适当支持时，我将重新添加专门针对中国用户的新折扣代码。

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add a "dragons played" counter (for Zarimi) for the opponent.
-   ✨ The "dragons summoned" counter for the opponent now only shows up in Wild, when the opponent is Druid

## Battlegrounds

-   🐞 Fix an issue where the MMR of opponents in the lobby would not be correctly retrieved
    -   This should now also work if all players have the same hero, like with the Marin anomaly
-   🐞 Add the missing "hero auras" (like the Bettle size) to the simulator

## Arena

-   ✨ Mousing over a Imbue or Starship Piece while drafting will now highlight all other Imbue / Starship cards in your decks, to better highlight synergies

## App

-   🐞 Fix some issues with dragging widgets around
