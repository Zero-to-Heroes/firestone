Remember that you can browse past release notes with the sidebar on the left - very useful if you missed one, as there can sometimes be multiple new releases per week.

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Stats shown above the tracker in-game will now always use the following filters: "All time", "All ranks", "All regions"
    -   They used to use the same filters as the ones from the app's main window, which allowed for more customization, but it was confusing.
-   ✨ Restrict the list of secrets that can be created by Harth Stonebrew
-   ✨ The "hero attacks" counter will now also show up when you have Kurtrus, Demon-Render in your deck
    -   The "Shocksplitter" counter has been slightly modified to serve in both cases
-   ✨ Small update in how the Colossus counter shows the information (it now shows up as `2 x 6`, instead of `2 x (1 + 5)`)
-   ✨ Update highlights (Seaweed Strike, Pet Parrot, Survival of the Fittest, Azerite Giant, Vulpera Toxinblade, Carress Cabaret Star, Tamsin Roame, Amorphous Slime, Anima Extractor, Grimy Gadgeteer)
-   ✨ Update dynamic pools (Pet Parrot, Starlight Whelp, Murozond the Infinite, Ferocious Felbat)
-   ✨ Discover stats will now disappear when clicking on the "hide" button in-game
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the weapon equipped by Selfless Sidekick would not be removed from your decklist
-   🐞 Fix an issue where playing a dormant minion would cause some secrets to be ruled out
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the "lobby" decklist would not let you scroll anymore

## Arena

-   ✨ Card search now supports full-width comma (，) when searching for multiple cards
    -   It will also only start filtering for cards after entering at least 2 characters
-   🐞 Fix an issue where cards being removed from the deck would still appear in the "lobby" decklist after the redraft
-   🐞 Fix some Hunter secrets appearing in the Secret Helper list while they can only be created by Harth Stonebrew
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the "become premium" banner would briefly flicker when viewing the package details for legendary picks, even if you were already a premium user

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ You can now highlight all "no tribe" minions in the shop, like you do for the other tribes
-   ✨ Trinket stats will now disappear when clicking on the "hide" button in-game
-   🐞 Fix an issue where some counters would incorrectly show up

## Replays

The goal of this update is to make replays easier to navigate. Remember that you can (and probably should) watch the replay in your browser to benefit from the full size of your screen (and for some users performances are better in the browser).

-   ✨ Add a button to view the replay online directly from the replays list in the app
    -   No need to first click to view the replay in-app!
-   ✨ Added a simplified events log. Clicking on any action in this log takes you directly to the corresponding spot in the game
    -   The event log shows different actions for BG and other game modes!
-   ✨ In non-BG games, decklists are shown to the right
-   ✨ Some actions are now skipped when navigating inside the game, which should make the whole experience smoother
    -   You can still view all the step-by-step details by using Shift + arrows, or clicking the appropriate button
-   ✨ Shows the "big card" whenever any card is played (like in game)
    -   Previously it would only show spells in that way
