## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add dynamic pool for the Larva created in the opponent's hand. This means you can mouse over it, and see the possible list of minions it transformed into
-   ✨ Add a counter for your next starship launch reduction
-   ✨ Add a counter for the number of Protoss spells you played this game (for Colossus)
-   ✨ Add a counter for the Protoss minion cost reduction (it will show the permanent cost reduction, as well as the cost reduction for your next minion)
    -   I haven't added counters for the other protoss reductions (like your next Protoss spell / card). If you think this would be needed, let me know on Discord :)
-   ✨ Add the permanent minions cost reduction from Photon Cannon and Artanis to the Global Effects

## Arena

-   ✨ When Discovering a card from another class - or simply a card where there isn't much data for your class - the stats will now use the "global" stats (including all classes, not only the one you're playing with)
