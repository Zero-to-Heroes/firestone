## Traveling Travel Agency mini-set

-   ‚ú® The app has been update for the latest mini-set. Enjoy!
    -   There are still a couple of cards that will need further implementation (like Dreamplanner Zephrys), which will probably in the near future

## Battlegrounds Simulator

-   ‚ú® Premium users can now activate an option to show partial simulation results, which means you can get results very quickly, and they are refined as time goes on.
-   ‚ú® Free users can use the partial results 2 games per day while in-game. It's completely free while using the offline simulator on the main app's window.
-   ‚ú® Added a setting to configure how long the simulator is allowed to run. By default, it's 8 seconds (8000ms), but this can be configured to better suit your config and/or your expectations.
-   üêû Fixed a sim issue where Indomitable Mount could spawn non-beast minions, which would mess up with Leapfrogger sims
-   üêû Fixed a sim issue where the app would crash when getting into a scenario where one side would get infinite spawns
