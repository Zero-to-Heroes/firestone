As usual with every BG patch, we have pushed mutliple updates over the last week. Here is a detailed summary of what happened :)

## Decktracker

- ✨ Add support for Rewind cards
- ✨ Add an "active" banner on discovered card if its effect will be active upon being discovered
- ✨ Add outcast counter (for Vengeful Walloper)
- ✨ Update highlights (Forge of Souls, High Cultist Basaleph, Nerubian Flyer, Cup O'Muscle)
    - Improve weapon highlights to include cards that equip a weapon
    - Fix an issue with Kindred highlights for the ALL tribe minions
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Synthesize, Crystal Broker, Rest in Peace, Containment Unit, Raylla Sand Sculptor, Zarog's Crown, Peaceful Piper, Habeas Corpses, Jungle Jammer)
    - Scrappy Scavenger now remembers how much mana was available after you played it, to always show the relevant dynamic card pool
- ✨ Update oracles (Priest quest reward, From De Other Side, Money Dispense-o-bot)
    - "Suspicious" cards should now work (i.e. flag the card in the opponent's hand) both when either you or the opponent play them
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the attack counter would be incorrect after stealing a minion from the opponent's board
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the menagerie counter tooltip would not be accurate enough in filtering the information about played tribes

## Battlegrounds

- ✨ Small rework of the APM widget to show peak APM and average widget instead of instant APM
    - Discovers now also count towards actions for the turn
- 🐞 Fixed simulation issues
    - The simulation is getting much better; it's not at pre-patch levels of accuray yet (in part because of bugs in HS itself), but it should get there soon
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the same game could appear multiple times in the Replays list
- 🐞 Fix small UI issues in the BG simulator

## Arena

- 🐞 Fix an issue where the same pick options could incorrectly appear for two picks in a row
- 🐞 Fix an issue where cards that work with cards "from another class" would sometimes highlight all cards

## Constructed

- ✨ Add a way to filter your decks based on the cards they contain

## App

- 🐞 Fix an issue where the lottery pop-up would appear unwantedly
