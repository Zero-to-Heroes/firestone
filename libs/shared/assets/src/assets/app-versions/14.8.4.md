## App

-   ✨ App has been updated for Hearthstone 31.4.2
-   ✨ Improve startup time

## Constructed

-   ✨ Individual Deck Card Stats are now available to all users (free & premium)
-   ✨ Added Discover Stats to the Meta Deck & Archetypes
    -   Available to everyone for free
    -   I'm not sure how useful this will be, mostly because of the low sample size, but I thought it could at least be interesting to see what it gives for some discover-heavy decks and archetypes

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add dynamic card pools (Sticky Up now shows the possible Quickdraw cards you can get)
-   ✨ Add card highlights (Green-Thumb Gardener, Illuminate, Murmuring Elemental)
-   🐞 Fix an issue where counters would randomly move around when they appeared if you hadn't moved them previously
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Larva's dynamic card pool was including Brood Queen
