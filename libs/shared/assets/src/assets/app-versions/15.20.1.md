## Battlegrounds

- ✨ You can now see the pro tips for each composition directly on the app's main window's Compositions page
- ✨ (PREMIUM) Update auto-highlights
    - Auto-highlights now use the current hero power, instead of the current hero, so they should work with Finley / Master Nguyen
    - Freedealing Gambler is now auto-highlighted if you have Flurgl's hero power
    - Freedealing Gambler is now auto-highlighted if you have Fungalmancer Portrait

## Decktracker

- ✨ Add a Dark Gifts counter for the opponent that shows all the unique Dark Gifts they have played
    - Very useful if you suspect them of having Wallow the Wretched
- ✨ Add a Corpses counter for the opponent that shows their current Corpses total
    - It appears when you need to know how many corpses they have (they have a corpse-spending card in hand or deck, like Corpsicle) and the in-game counter isn't visible
    - It uses Corpsicle's card as an icon, but it doesn't look very corpse-y. Hit me up if you have suggestions for other cards to use!
- ✨ Add an opacity slider for the Minions Play Order
- ✨ Playing Cera'thine Fleetrunner now updates the known minions in your deck
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Pyrotechnician, Wakener of Souls, Maze Guide, Distress Signal, Omega Assembly, Wallow the Wretched, Free from Amber)
- ✨ Update global effects (City Chief Esho)
- ✨ Update highlights (Slippery Slope, Barrel of Sludge synergies)
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the opponent playing a multi-class hero card could change the displayed matchup winrate
- 🐞 Fix oracles for Harth Stonebrew
- 🐞 Fix an issue where triggering the same deathrattle multiple times could sometimes cause the relevant counter to not update (eg Protoss minion cost reduction)
- 🐞 Fix an issue where some cards could be indicated as 0-cost in the opponent's tracker
- 🐞 Fix an issue where discarded cards could have a "?" cost in the opponent's tracker
- 🐞 Try to fix an issue where Zilliax would sometimes appear at an incorrect place in the opponent's list
