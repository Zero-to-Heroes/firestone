Remember that you can browse past release notes with the sidebar on the left - very useful if you missed one, as there can sometimes be multiple new releases per week.

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Stats shown above the tracker in-game will now always use the following filters: "All time", "All ranks", "All regions"
    -   They used to use the same filters as the ones from the app's main window, which allowed for more customization, but it was confusing.
-   ✨ Restrict the list of secrets that can be created by Harth Stonebrew
-   ✨ The "hero attacks" counter will now also show up when you have Kurtrus, Demon-Render in your deck
    -   The "Shocksplitter" counter has been slightly modified to serve in both cases
-   ✨ Small update in how the Colossus counter shows the information (it now shows up as `2 x 6`, instead of `2 x (1 + 5)`)
-   ✨ Update highlights (Seaweed Strike, Pet Parrot, Survival of the Fittest, Azerite Giant, Vulpera Toxinblade, Carress Cabaret Star)
-   ✨ Update dynamic pools (Pet Parrot, Starlight Whelp, Murozond the Infinite, Ferocious Felbat)
-   ✨ Discover stats will now disappear when clicking on the "hide" button in-game
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the weapon equipped by Selfless Sidekick would not be removed from your decklist
-   🐞 Fix an issue where playing a dormant minion would cause some secrets to be ruled out

## Arena

-   ✨ Card search now supports full-width comma (，) when searching for multiple cards
    -   It will also only start filtering for cards after entering at least 2 characters
-   🐞 Fix some Hunter secrets appearing in the Secret Helper list while they can only be created by Harth Stonebrew
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the "become premium" banner would briefly flicker when viewing the package details for legendary picks, even if you were already a premium user

-   ✨ You can now highlight all "no tribe" minions in the shop, like you do for the other tribes
-   ✨ Trinket stats will now disappear when clicking on the "hide" button in-game
