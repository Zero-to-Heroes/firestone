## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ First version of the Compositions Stats tab in the app! Look up which comps perform best at each rank
    -   This is still experimental, as I'm working on improving composition detection in games - let me know if you see something that is not correctly assigned in your Replays!

## Arena

-   ✨ High-win decks should now have a better representation of the legendaries across the board
    -   So if you're looking for a specific class / legendary combination, you're more likely to find it

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Update dynamic pools (Watcher of the Sun, I Know a Guy, Ivory Rook, False Disciple)
    -   Cards that get you another card based on your mana left now take into account the cost to play the card
-   ✨ Add a setting to enable / disable all counters at once

## Replays

-   ✨ Add a setting to hide games vs AI when viewing the full list of replays
