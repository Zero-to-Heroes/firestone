## App

-   ✨ App has been updated for version 30.0.3.

## Guilds

-   ✨ Add an Internal MMR for Friendly battles. This is still experimental and may be replaced by a system for creating on-demand, temporary ladders or tournaments. Feedback is welcome from guild members using this feature!

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add an Elemental Streak counter for the opponent, tracking how many elementals they've played consecutively. It only appears if the opponent has played at least 2 elementals in a row and is deactivated by default.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the opponent trading a card would not make it appear in their deck.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where "pay with health" cards like Blood Treant would count towards the self-damage widget (used by Party Planner Vona).
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the attack counter would not always update (e.g., when playing a minion whose aura buffs your board).

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ Add a counter for how many pirates you've played this game. It only appears if buddies are active and you're Patches, or if you have Tuskarr Raider (Patches' buddy) in hand or on board.
-   I've noticed that the accuracy of the BG sim is down since the patch; I'm keeping an eye out and will probably release another version with some updates later today

## Collection

-   ✨ Add missing catch-up packs to the Packs tab.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where receiving a golden card in a pack would reset the pity timer for the corresponding rarity.
