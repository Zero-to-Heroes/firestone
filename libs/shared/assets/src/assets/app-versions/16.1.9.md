## Decktracker

- ✨ Firestone now lets you differentiate between cards drawn / created in the opponent hand
    - For cards where making this distinction matters, the order in which the card was added / created will be added next to the "gift" icon
    - You will now be able to see distinct dynamic pools for these cards
    - For instance: if the opponent plays Identity Theft, you will know which card was created from your hand and which one from your deck, and will be able to see all the possible options for each
- ✨ The Secrets Helper will now use the appropriate card pool in the Tavern Brawl (when applicable)
- ✨ Update highlights (Lab Patron, Succumb to Madness)
- ✨ Update oracles (Jumpscare, Shadowflame Suffusion)
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Megafin, Botface, Vulpera Scoundrel)
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the opponent's Protoss minion cost reduction counter would not always get reset using Warpgate and playing a Protoss minion
- 🐞 Fix an issue where secrets destroyed by Observer of Mysteries would not get removed from the "Board" zone
