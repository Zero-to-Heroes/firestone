## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ You can now browse individual card stats in the main app, under Battlegrounds > Cards.
    -   They track the play impact on each card on the average final position, based on the turn you play it

## Arena

-   ✨ You can now permanently hide the premium banner during the Draft phase and while Discovering cards in-game without having to turn the full feature off.
    -   Let me know how you like this improvement, so I can add it to other parts of the app :)
