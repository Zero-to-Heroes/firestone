## App

-   I did some major rework of how games are uploaded. It should be transparent to you, but if you notice anything weird (replay not found, stats missing, etc.), please let me know!

## Arena

-   ✨ You can now see an overview of your Arena runs, including the decklist used and the picks made during the draft. Let me know if there are more things you'd like to see there!
-   ✨ Add a setting to change the size of the overlay while drafting.

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ Add a counter to tell you how many different spells you've played, and which ones.
-   ✨ Piloted Whirl-o-Tron is now supported in the simulator.
-   🐞 Fix a sim issue where battlecries that had no effects on the combat (tavern-only battlecries) would not trigger Kalecgos when triggered in combat (e.g. by Rylak).
-   🐞 Fix a sim issue where Fish of N'Zoth would sometimes spawn traitor minions that would attack their own warband.

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add a setting to ignore the discard / burned / dead / etc. status when grouping cards with the same card ID.
-   ✨ Don't show destroyed Locations as being in the Graveyard.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Fracking wouldn't draw from the bottom of the deck.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the attack counter could not properly take the hero attack into account during the other player's turn.

## Mercenaries

-   ✨ Text search now also searches in the merc's faction.
