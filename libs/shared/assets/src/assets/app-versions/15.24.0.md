## General

- ✨ Improve performance of the app overall.
    - This should be especially noticeable on screens with lots of repeating widgets, like the BG cards list, the decktracker, or deck builder
- ✨ Added a link to the new Firestone website at the top of the app's main window
    - The website is brand new and will continue to evolve, but its goal is to provide you with free stats and resources on the web, for the cases where you can't access the app easily

## Decktracker

- ✨ Add a new mechanism that should handle "linked cards"
    - For instance, when the opponent plays Thistle Tea (draw a card and creates two copies) and plays one of the 3 cards, the other two will be marked with the actual card, since we now know what it is
- ✨ When an opponent draws a card with a tutor (like "draw a murloc from your deck"), the information about the card at the top of their deck is now removed
    - As we don't know if they drew that specific card, or if another was drawn. That would cause some incorrect information to be displayed in their hand.
- ✨ Secrets created by Fifflefire Imp are now restricted to be Fire secrets in the Secrets Helper
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Vast Wisdom, Petty Theft, Umbral Geist, Flight of the Bronze, Bonecaller)
    - Beast Speaker Taka's dynamic pool now uses the stats it gained to narrow down the list of possible minions it will spawn as part of its deathrattle (when played by the opponent)
- ✨ Update highlights (Drakkari Embalmer, Whirlweaver)
- ✨ Update oracles (Avant-Gardening)
- 🐞 Fix an issue where scrolling with the mouse wasn't working on the Secrets Helper anymore

## Battlegrounds

- ✨ Compositions in the "Compositions" tab of the app's main window will now be sorted by their "Expert rating" by default
- ✨ Updated some reference minions for the banned tribes / cards list widgets
- 🐞 Fix an issue where conceding a game in Solo Battlegrounds would not be detected by the app
- 🐞 Fix an issue where scrolling the cards list could get broken when using a big scale for the widget
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the final warband would often not appear in the Replays tab after restarting the app
