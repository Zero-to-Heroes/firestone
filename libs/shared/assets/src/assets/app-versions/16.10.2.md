## Lottery

It has been possible to deal "infinite" damage under some circumstances, and the database is not equipped to deal with such high numbers. Given how the lottery works, it will unfortunately be impossible for me to rollback the instances of infinite damage, so I have decided to start the new season earlier than expected, and pick 4 winners to make up for the missing session.
