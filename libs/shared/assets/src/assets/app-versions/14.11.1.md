You may have noticed that there have been many updates over the past week. These aimed at fixing issues from the latest Battlegrounds patch, mostly in the simulator, and didn't contain detailed release notes. I will try to summarize here the main things that were released over the past few days :)

## Battlegrounds

-   🐞 Fixed many simulator issues. It's not yet at the pre-patch level of accuracy, but it's getting pretty good
-   ✨ The minions list now includes the new Starcraft minions when you're playing as one of the heroes that can generate them
-   ✨ Add an Anomaly Filter in the Heroes Stats tab (for now only for Solo)
-   ✨ BG replays now display the active Anomaly
-   ✨ Compositions tab has been temporarily deactivated until we figure out the new meta and can build a new list

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add or fix card highlights (Product 9, Big Dreams, Murkwater Scribe, better highlights for starship-related cards like SCV to include cards that generate starship pieces)
-   🐞 Fixed an issue where the opponent's Colossus counter wouldn't show up in some cases
