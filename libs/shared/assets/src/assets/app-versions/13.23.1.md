## Battlegrounds Simulator

-   ✨ Premium users can now activate an option to show partial simulation results, which means you can get results very quickly, and they are refined as time goes on.
-   ✨ Free users can use the partial results 2 games per day while in-game. It's completely free while using the offline simulator on the main app's window.
-   ✨ Added a setting to configure how long the simulator is allowed to run. By default, it's 8 seconds (8000ms), but this can be configured to better suit your config and/or your expectations.
