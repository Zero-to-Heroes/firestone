## App

The app has been updated for 31.0! Enjoy the new Brawl :)

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Change how related cards are displayed for Galactic Project Orb: they are now ordered by mana cost, and only one card of each mana cost is displayed
    -   The spells you have played and that are not shown are highlighted in a different color in the tracker's Other zone
-   ✨ Add a "Dead minions" counter for the opponent
    -   It shows up when we know they have Reska in their deck, or if they are Death Knight
    -   It is off by default
-   ✨ Add a setting to hide duplicated cards when viewing related cards in tooltips
    -   Certain cards (mostly the ones that resurrect minions, like Raise Dead) use ALL dead cards to pick their targets. This means that, if you have 5 Boars and one Kvaldir dead, you will have a higher chance to resurrect a Boar.
    -   However, several users have found that confusing, and would rather not show any duplicate in that list. If that's you, please turn on this new setting :)
-   ✨ Add a "Dragons Played" counter for Kazakusan
-   ✨ Improved support for cards like Disguised K'Thir, which now show the card in the opponent's deck as it is revealed.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Hydration Station would not flag taunted Zilliax
-   🐞 Fix an issue where minions that go dormant as you play them (like Corridor Creeper) would incorrectly cause some secrets (like Explosive Runes) to get greyed out
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Prince Renathal would not appear in global effects

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ You can now pin a minion by right-clicking on it on the list (instead of having to click on the smaller "pin" icon)
-   ✨ You can also pin all minions of a single tribe / mechanics by right-clicking the tribe/mechanics icon in the navigation pane at the top
-   ✨ Add a "No tribe" filter group in the minions list
-   ✨ Add a header when viewing all minions for a single tribe or mechanics, which has a button to highlight all minions for that tribe/mechanics
-   ✨ Trinkets are now grouped by lesser/greater aspect when browsing Tribe and Power tiers
-   🐞 Fix an issue where you could not navigate across the various tabs when watch stats of a past replay
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the HP per turn info would sometimes be incomplete
-   🐞 Fix an issue where 0-cost trinkets would not appear in the cards list widget
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the hero selection overlay scale would not persist between games

## Replays

-   ✨ Add a search field to filter your games by hero / class played more easily

## Misc

-   🐞 Fix an issue where some quest text would be weirdly displayed in the quest widget
