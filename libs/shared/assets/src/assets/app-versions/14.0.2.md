## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ First version of the Compositions tab in the minions list overlay is out!
    -   You can browse all the main meta compositions, filtered based on the tribes currently in the lobby
    -   Compositions are split between "Core" cards (which you absolutely need) and "Add-ons" (which support the main composition)
    -   It's still a very early version; I know there is a lot of work still needed to explain what all of this is, how compositions work, and so on
    -   This has been developed in partnership with Minder, from the [BG Curvesheet](https://www.bgcurvesheet.com/). Minder has already been providing tips for Heroes and Trinkets, so I'm super happy to get his expertise on this as well :)
