## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ You can now browse trinket stats in the main app!
-   ✨ Trinket stats are now available directly in the overlay. Free users can access this feature 4 times per day (approximately 2 games), while it's unlimited for premium users.
-   ✨ Trinkets are now displayed in various Battlegrounds widgets, such as the next opponent overview (when mousing over a portrait on the leaderboard), the quick opponents view (by pressing tab for Premium users), or the overall opponents view (in the Battlegrounds window).
-   ✨ The trinket list now only shows available trinkets based on the current lobby tribes.
-   ✨ The trinket list now grays out trinkets that can't be offered with your current board (e.g., some trinkets require you to have 2 minions of a certain type between your board and hand). It also provides explanations for why they are grayed out. The rules for this feature are still being refined, so feedback on any inconsistencies is welcome.
-   ✨ Mousing over the trinkets in the minions list now displays the related cards (e.g., if you're unsure what "Dreamer's Embrace" is, you can find out here).
-   🐞 Fixed an issue where achievements for Marin were showing those for Madam Goya.
-   🐞 Continued work on fixing simulation issues; more fixes are expected in the coming week.

## Decktracker

-   🐞 Fixed an issue where deck codes could not be copied from the Meta Decks tab.
-   🐞 Fixed an issue where the new "Perils in Paradise" Coins were causing errors in mulligan stats.
-   🐞 Fixed an issue where Tyr would only highlight Paladin cards when mousing over them in the tracker.
