## App

-   ✨ Add a mirror location to download the cards database file. I hope this will help users who are having the "CRITICAL ERROR" message about cards not loading properly.
    -   As usual, if you're facing this kind of error and the provided troubleshooting steps don't help, please don't hesitate to open a bug report from the app
-   ✨ Reduce the number of places where the "go premium to unlock stats" banner appears. I'm still tweaking this, so any feedback is welcome
    -   The main reason is that I want to make sure that new features don't go unnoticed.
    -   Some elements already have the ability to hide the premium banner forever, and this can be extended to more places

## Tracker

-   ✨ Secrets created by the Magic Wisdomball will now properly be shown to be either Ice Barrier or Counterspell
-   ✨ Counters now only use the deck's starting class to decide whether or not to show up. So if your opponent morphs into a Lich King halfway through, the Reska counter shouldn't appear anymore
    -   It also tries to use the class from Tourist cards, if they are triggered
-   ✨ Add card highlights (Free Admission, Bunny Stomper, Shudderblock token, Roosting Gargoyle)
-   🐞 Fix an issue where countered cards would be considered as "played this match" for Archimonde
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the discover stats overlay layout would break with 4 options
-   🐞 Fix an issue where card highlights for spellschool minions would not work as intended
-   🐞 Fix an issue where dynamic card pools would not show anything anymore

## Arena

-   🐞 Fix an issue where mousing over a card in the draft would not highlight synergies anymore

## Collection

-   🐞 Fix an issue where the pack history was not returned in chronological order anymore, thereby messing up the pity timers.
