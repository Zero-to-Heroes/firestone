## App

-   ✨ Add a setting to change the size of all widgets in the app globally
    -   I'm now trying to figure out a way to default this global setting based on the screen resolution in a way that doesn't mess up with everyone's existing setup :)

## Dectracker

-   ✨ Add a new widget that shows the max health/mana if they changed this game
-   ✨ Add the deck's winrate to the "lobby" decklist that can you peruse before going into a game
-   ✨ Add card highlights (Funkfin, Wreck'em and Deck'em)
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Photon Cannon's global effect was sometimes attributed to Artanis

## Battlegrounds

-   🐞 Fix an issue where the Naga spell counter was counting backwards
