Remember that you can browse past release notes with the sidebar on the left - very useful if you missed one, as there can sometimes be multiple new releases per week.

## Decktracker

-   ✨ New look for the card tiles in the tracker view!
    -   Card images are now properly centered and zoomed out, so it's easier to recognize the cards from their tile images
    -   IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT: You can deactivate the blur effect from the Settings, under the Appearance tab
-   ✨ Add a warning icon on the "discovering card stats" overlay when there is a low sample size
-   ✨ Update highlights (Ramkahen Wildtamer, Kolkar Pack Runner, Nine Lives, Ancient of Growth, Briliant Macaw, Seafloor Savior, Forsaken Lieutenant)
    -   Cards that rely on "from another class" cards (like Tess) now also highlight cards that create cards from another class
    -   Riff cards now highlight other Riff cards
-   ✨ Update dynamic pools (Netherwalker, False Disciple, Lightning Reflexes, Felerin the Forgotten)
-   ✨ Mousing over the opponent's Starlight Whelp (in the tracker) tells you the cards they had in their opening hand that we know about
-   🐞 Fix an issue where unknown cards were incorrectly grouped together when the "show gifts separately" option was turned off
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the Anachronos counter would not show up when played by the active player
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the cost in hand for cards drawn while spectating would sometimes be marked with "?"

## Arena

-   ✨ Add a warning icon on the "discovering card stats" overlay when there is a low sample size
-   ✨ Update the leaderboard average formula
    -   When above 30 runs, the last run now counts for 10% of the new total
    -   Please let me know if this still needs to be adjusted :)
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the dynamic pool for "from the past" cards would incorrectly use the arena-specific discover card pool
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the cards shown in your deck during the redraft phase might sometimes not update

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ Add an option to remove the "out of bounds" protection for the cards list. Remove that protection if you're having trouble positioning the cards list exactly as you want it
