## Arena

-   ✨ Mulligan guide is live for Arena! Upon card selection during the mulligan, the app will show an overlay with the impact / pick rate of the cards being offered, as well as the impact of all cards in your deck. Premium users have unlimited use of this feature, while others can use it for up to 3 games per day.
-   ✨ Add the "Played on Curve Winrate" stat to the Cards Stats tab.

## Decktracker

-   ✨ A new "Competitive" rank filter is available for meta stats (decks and archetypes). The idea is to limit the stats to users who are really trying to win, and so only includes Top 2000 Legend and Diamond 1-4 players. The mulligan overlay data still includes all players from Diamond to Legend to make sure the sample size is big enough, but this can be adjusted in the future.

## Battlegrounds

-   🐞 Fix some sim issues for Duos. There will still be quite a few iterations needed, but I'm finally starting to address Duos-specific sim issues :slight_smile:
-   🐞 Fix a display issue where the hero card would be incorrect in the battle recap tab if your teammate went first.

## Achievements

-   🐞 Fix an issue where the "back" arrow had disappeared.

## General

-   🐞 Fix an issue where you had to click twice on the Firestone system tray icon to restore the app's main window.
