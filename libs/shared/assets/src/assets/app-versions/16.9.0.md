## Decktracker

- ✨ Improve card guesses for linked cards
    - For instance, when a card is copied by Rangari Scout and revealed later, the copy will be revealed
- ✨ Update the card tooltip display when there is some additional info to show
    - The additional info will show at the top, and below it you'll see the card pool (if there is one)
- ✨ Update the card tooltip to close when clicking on it
    - The "close by pressing q" was not really user-friendly, so let me know if this feels better
- ✨ Leaving the mouse over a card name in the tracker will make its name scroll if it's too long to fit
- ✨ Update global effects (Turbulus, Master Dusk)
- ✨ Update oracles (Lie in Wait, Way of the Shell, Bob's Find a Triple, Xavius, Portal Vanguard, Offensive Play)
    - Fix an issue where some Miniaturize cards would not correctly reveal their mini in the opponent's hand
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Jar Dealer, Witch's Apprentice)
- ✨ Update highlights (Starcraft cards, Joymancer Jepetto)
