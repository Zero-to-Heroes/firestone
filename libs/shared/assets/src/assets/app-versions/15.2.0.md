## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add an Imbue counter
    -   While the information is available when mousing over the hero power, it can become hidden in some cases, like when you play a hero card (like Exarch Naielle)
    -   It's also pretty nice be to able to see the value at a glance, but if you don't like the visual overload it can be easily deactivated from the settings, like all the other counters
    -   I've kept the on/off rules for the counter rather simply (Malorne in deck or Imbue > 0), but don't hesitate to let me know if you'd need something more sophisticated
-   ✨ Add counters for Aessina, Book of the Dead
-   ✨ Add oracles (= information on the card on the opponent's hand) for Demonic Project, Dark Gift, Mimicry, Raza the Resealed
    -   Update the order of cards in hand created by Harth Stonebrew
-   ✨ Add dynamic related cards for Wallow the Wretched, Carry-on Suitcase, Hungering Ancient, Ursoc, Whack-A-Gnoll
-   ✨ Cards created by Demonic Deal, Q'onzu or the Dark Gift now properly appear on Top of Deck
-   ✨ Add or fix highlights for Sorcerer's Gambit (Mage's questline), Ferocious Felbat
    -   Sorcerer's Gambit now only highlight the spells that have the correct spell schools
-   🐞 Fix an issue where secrets like Rat Trap could be incorrectly greyed out after a card was countered this turn (like with Ice Trap)
-   🐞 Fix an issue where some highlights using cost would not handle Zilliax correctly
-   🐞 Fix an issue where some dynamic pools were not correctly updating
-   🐞 Fix a visual issue where the counters would briefly flicker at the top left corner of the screen before moving to their correct position
-   🐞 Fix a visual issue where the Discover stats could cover the mana cost of cards when they had a Dark Gift
-   🐞 Fix a visual issue where the opponent's Max Resources widget could not be resized independently of the player's widget

## Constructed

-   🐞 Fix an issue where where viewing details for a specific version of a merged deck would break stats when viewing another deck

## Arena

-   ✨ Add Total run time in the My Runs tab recap
    -   Mousing over it also gives you the average time per game
