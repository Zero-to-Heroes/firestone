## Decktracker

- ✨ Add a "current effecs" section next to the Global Effects
    - Please let me know if some effects should be tracked but arent: the list of tracked effects is maintained manually, to avoid pollution and conflicts with other tracking methods (like the counters)
    - There is an option in the settings to use the enchantment name instead of the card name
- ✨ Improve handling of Broxigar's Start of Game effect
    - It will now mark the other cards from its Fabled package as in the opponent's deck
- ✨ Imported decklists are now preserved after Rewinding the Timeline
- ✨ You can now copy your opponent's partial decklist from the tracker
- ✨ You can now decide what's the maximum related cards to show in tooltips
    - As usual, it's in the Settings (under Widgets)
- ✨ The tracker should now correctly handle your opponent's stealing a card from your deck (e.g. with Doommaiden) then playing it
- ✨ The tracker should now correctly reverts the bottom / top sections of the deck after playing Timeless Causality
- ✨ Add support for a bunch of cards in the Current Effects section
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Maestra Mask Merchant, Botface, Ressucitate, Relic Miner, Déjà Vu, The Fins Beyond Time, Wishing Well, Natural Talent, Nightmare Fuel, Incriminating Psychic, Assimilating Blight, Magister Dawngrasp, Bwonsamdi, First Contact, Botface)
- ✨ Update highlights (Giftwrapped Whelp, Twisted Webweaver, Chromie, Swindle, Wish Upon A Star, Robocaller, Perennial Serpent)
- ✨ Update oracles (Violet Spellwing, Replicator-inator, Lorewalker Cho, Cosmonaut, Everburning Phoenix, Ysera the Dreamer, Birdwatching, Future Conflux, Umpire's Grasp, Platysaur, Talanji of the Graves)
    - Flag the card copied by Sketch Artist when the temporary copy is discarded
- 🐞 Tentative fix for an issue where the tracker could give incorrect information when choosing the "Rewind Timeline" option too quickly after playing a Rewind card
    - Logs are doing some really weird things in this case, so there are probably still some issues lingering
- 🐞 Fix an issue where picking "Rewind the Timeline" would be counted as a Discover for the Discover counter
- 🐞 Fix an issue where playing City Chief Esho while not active would still add it to the Global Effects
- 🐞 Fix an issue where playing a multi-class hero (like Artanis) could change your current class in the tracker
- 🐞 Fix an issue where deleting a deck would not do anything
- 🐞 Fix an issue where importing a deck for the opponent would remove the known top/bottom cards
- 🐞 Fix an issue where cards created Rangari Scout could get mixed up after several cards were Discovered

## Battlegrounds

- ✨ Add an Undead Army counter, that tracks your Undead attack bonus
- ✨ Add a Deep Blues counter
- ✨ Restore the Naga Spell counter
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the Shop Tavern Buff was not working anymore
- 🐞 Fix a couple of small-ish sim issues
    - The simulator is in a good place right now, and should give accurate result
    - The only composition that still requires some work is Silent Enforcer (especially golden) + Lord of the Ruins, especially when Titus is present

## Replays

- ✨ Mousing over the opponent's name in the Replays list will show you their battle tag
    - I want to build something to let you find the tags for your opponents / teammates in Battlegrounds, but this will be more complex UI-wise

## Constructed

- 🐞 Fix an issue where non-collectible cards (like Fabled cards) would be counted towards the dust cost of decks

## Collection

- ✨ The "Best Opened Packs" section is now in its own tab, which lets you browse ALL the packs that you have opened while Firestone was running
