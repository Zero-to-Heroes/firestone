This version adds a lot of performance improvements while in-game. This should be mostly visible in Battlegrounds, but I hope it will fix the issues that some of you have been getting where widgets would get stuck for a while after the game ends.

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ The "Comps" tab in the minions list is finally back! It brings the most popular builds for the current meta, along with a rough estimation of their power level
    -   Thanks to Slyders, a former #1 leaderboard player and regular top 10 finisher, for putting this together!
-   ✨ Trinket stats overlay is back!
-   ✨ Add a counter for the current Elementals Tavern Buff
