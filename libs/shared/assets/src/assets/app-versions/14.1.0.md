## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ Add a very basic first implementation of Card Stats
    -   This will evolve in the future. There are many things I want to consider, like being able to compare minions (or spells) of different tiers. So expect further experimentations :)

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add an indicator for demons created by Kil'jaeden in the opponent's hand to show their current bonus level
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the "show updated cost" setting would not always work, and sometimes would not show the "base" cost of cards
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the Corpse counter would not show up once a Death Knight opponent has played one rune of each
-   🐞 Fix an issue where playing a Hero class could prevent some counters from appearing
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the total attack on board would be incorrect right after a Starship got launched by Exodar
-   🐞 Fix an issue where playing cards like Golden Kobold would not override the card markers in the opponent's hand
