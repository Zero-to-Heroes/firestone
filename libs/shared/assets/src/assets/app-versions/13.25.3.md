## Decktracker

-   ✨ Mousing over Scenic Vista in the Global Effects section will now show the spells it will replay
-   🐞 Fix an issue where some Objective cards were not removed from Global Effects once destroyed
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Rest in Peace would show too many minions on mouse over
-   🐞 Fix an issue where generated secrets (and other generated cards) would not have a mana cost in the tracker

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ Hero stats in the overay will now default to top 10% of players if your MMR is higher than that. This is to prevent weird stats from appearing because of low sample sizes.
    -   You can still use the top 1% filter when browsing stats in the app itself, but not having a way to see / update that filter and getting very strange results in the overlay was confusing.

## Collection

-   🐞 Fix an issue where the rarity gem would not display correctly when viewing cards history (Premium)
