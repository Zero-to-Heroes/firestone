## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ First version of the Compositions Stats tab in the app! Look up which comps perform best at each rank
    -   The "Power" stat is my take on trying to assign a numerical value to how strong compositions are. More details at https://github.com/Zero-to-Heroes/firestone/wiki/Battlegrounds-Compositions-Power-stat
    -   Let me know if you see some oddities!
-   ✨ Perfect games now also list the comp type, and lets you filter to only include games with that comp
-   ✨ Compositions have been updated to more accurately reflect the current meta
    -   Comps are provided by Slyders, who got multiple #1 finishes on the leaderboard
-   ✨ Removed the Anomalies filter, as there was not enough data for the results to be really reliable
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the player boards could sometimes be incorrectly detected, mostly after a reconnect
-   🐞 (PREMIUM) Don't auto-highlight Elementals when playing when Chenvalaa at tier 6+

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Update highlights (Shadowcloth Needle, Spelunker, Imp King Rafaam, The Galactic Projection Orb)
    -   Add a "reverse kindred" highlight: when mousing over a card with a tribe / spell school, it will highlight Kindred cards with that tribe / spell school
    -   Cards created by Blasteroid are tagged as fire spells, and so will be highlighted by Living Flame
-   ✨ Update dynamic pools (Bloodpetal Biome, Kaja'mite Creation, Power of Creation, Relic of Kings, Endbringer Umbra, The Nighthold, Time-Lost Protodrake)
-   ✨ Update oracles (Everburning Phoenix, Darkrider, Expired Merchant)
-   🐞 Fix an info leak when drawing a card created in deck by Merchant of Legends
-   🐞 Fix an issue where mousing over the opponent's Tidepool Pupil would not give you an overview of the three spells they chose from, if the Pupil was part of their initial hand

## Constructed

-   🐞 Fix an issue where games played early after a patch hits would not appear in the My Decks section
-   🐞 (PREMIUM) Fix an issue where some games could be missing from the right-side panel of the My Decks page

## Arena

-   🐞 Fix an issue with some picks not being properly registered, mostly during Redraft
-   🐞 Fix an issue with dynamic pools of "from the past" cards in Arena
-   🐞 Changing filters in the main app's window won't impact the stats shown in the draft overlay anymore
