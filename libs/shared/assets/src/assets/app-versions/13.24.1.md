## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ Thanks to RDU (who you can [watch on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rdulive) for more insights), you can now access tips for each trinket directly in the minions list. This has shown me a few strategies I was not aware of, and I hope they will help you as well :)
-   ✨ Premium users can see these tips directly in the overlay, as each option is being offered. Free users can use this twice per day (same as the overlay stats).

## Battlegrounds Simulator

-   ✨ Partial simulation results (which let you get some sim results early) are not paywalled anymore, and are available to everyone.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where clicking on "Reset" in the simulator UI would clear both boards, instead of reverting the battle to its initial state.
-   ✨ Added a "Clear" button to completely clear both boards.

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add a "Discovery" zone in the tracker that shows the cards being offered as Discover options. This will make it easier to view related cards and synergies highlights in your deck
    -   ✨ And most notably, when playing Dreamplanner Zephrys, you will be able to see all the cards that you can get from picking each option
    -   You can of course turn that new zone off from the Settings
-   ✨ When playing Envoy of Prosperity, the card at the top of your deck will properly appear in a "Top of deck" section
-   🐞 Fix an issue where discovering Zilliax from your deck would set its cost to 0
-   🐞 Fix an issue where weapons equipped would not appear in the "Other" zone
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Hydration Station's related cards would also include non-taunt minions
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the "Show Stats Change" setting (to show boosts to some cards in your deck, like Incendius' Eruptions) would not be properly applied when using the classic layout
-   🐞 Fix an issue where cards played last turn would sometimes be incorrect, thus leading to some missing info on cards like Sasquawk

## Constructed tab

-   🐞 Fix an issue where clicking on "Reset" in the card select dropdown from the Meta Decks tab would select all cards, thus leading to no result
