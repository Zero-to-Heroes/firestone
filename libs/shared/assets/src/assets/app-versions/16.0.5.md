## App

- ‚ú® Firestone now supports mods! Mods are third-party programs that let you modify some elements directly in the game. They range from changing how some things look, to adding new features, sometimes even including performance improvements. With this update, you will be able to easily manage mods for Firestone
    - This means Auto-Squelch is finally possible :)
    - ‚ö† Mods are officially against the game's Terms of Service, so use at your own risk
    - The page at https://github.com/Zero-to-Heroes/firestone/wiki/Mods will list some mods that I have personally reviewed, and that I think are safe to use.
    - Please reach out if you have some ideas that could be nice / fun to have :)
