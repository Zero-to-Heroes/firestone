You may have noticed the app updating multiple times over the course of the week, without release notes. That's mostly because I'm still fixing small issues at a rapid pace following the patch, and don't want to overload you with multiple small release notes. So for now I am release bigger patch notes on Mondays, with a recap of what happened during the week.  
Let me know what you think on Discord :)
