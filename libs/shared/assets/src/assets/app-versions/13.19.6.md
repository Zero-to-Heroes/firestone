## Decktracker

-   ✨ Add support for "open decklist" brawls, revealing both players' lists when they are known before the match. This applies to this week's brawl (Henchmania!) and will improve support for future brawls.
-   ✨ Overheal cards now highlight cards that restore health.
-   ✨ Add more card oracles (flagging cards in the opponent's hand) and card highlights.
-   ✨ The mulligan guide now appears when playing against the AI. It won't use any of your free daily uses if you're not a premium subscriber.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Reska's dead minions counter only included minions that died on your side.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Rest in Peace would not show Popstar as a potential target.
-   🐞 Reset remembered spells for cards like Tidepool Pupil / Commander Sivara when they are put back in the deck.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the constructed deckbuilder would allow all cards from another class (instead of only Perils in Paradise cards) when adding a Tourist.

## Battlegrounds

-   🐞 Fix a simulation issue with Shadowy Construct.
