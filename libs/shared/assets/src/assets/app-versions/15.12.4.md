## Arena

The app is NOT YET updated for the new Arena and Arena Underground modes. Support will come progressively, as I figure out how the new game modes work and what exactly needs to be done.

## Decktracker

-   ‚ú® The mulligan guide overlays now also let you filter by going first / going second
    -   Both in the in-game overlay, and the lobby decktracker (that one is premium-only)
    -   Quick reminder that while the mulligan guide overlay is a premium feature, free users can use it for 3 games every day
-   ‚ú® Play / coin mulligan information is also available on the Meta Decks and Meta Archetypes pages when drilling down into a specific deck / archetype
    -   This is available for free for all users
-   ‚ú® Add a Protoss Cost Reduction counter for the opponent
    -   It will show up as soon as they get a reduction going
-   ‚ú® The opponent's Colossus Damage counter has been reworked
    -   It now displays exactly how the damage is calculated, to avoid any confusion (e.g. 2 x (1 + 6))
    -   It also shows up for the opponent if they are Rogue or Priest and have played at least one Protoss Spell
-   ‚ú® Add card highlights (Oasis Outlaws, Predation, Bubble Bot, Cariel Roame, Devout Pupil, Naga's Pride, Serpentbloom, Myrmidon)
-   ‚ú® Add/fix dynamic pools (Gorilla-Bot, Mismatched Fossils, Spot the Difference)
-   üêû Fix an issue where counters like Naga Giant would sometimes incorrectly use the base cost of the card, instead of the actual cost (which could include discounts)
-   üêû Fix an issue where some counters would not appear in some cases (e.g. the Libram played counter for the opponent)
-   üêû Fix an issue where secrets would not leave the "board" zone in the tracker after triggering

## Battlegrounds

-   ‚ú® The compositions tab now includes tips on how to play each of the compositions that have been proposed!
    -   The tips have been carefully constructed by Slyders, who has achieved multiple rank 1 finishes on the leaderboard
-   ‚ú® The "no tribes" section of the cards list now includes trinkets that have specific synergies with no-tribe minions

## App

-   There was a big internal refactoring that should improve performances when playing Battlegrounds. Let me know if you notice anything :)
