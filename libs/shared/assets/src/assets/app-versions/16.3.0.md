## Decktracker

- ✨ After playing Azalina Soulthief or Mindrender Illucia, the full opponent's hand is now marked with the exact cards
- ✨ Mousing over cards created by Raza the Resealed in the deck now shows the list of cards they can be
- ✨ Add a Rafaam counter
    - Mousing over it shows you the details of which Rafaams have been played or not, ordered by mana cost
- ✨ When an opponent plays a Fabled card, the other cards from the Fabled package are automatically added to their "in deck" section
- ✨ Cards put to the bottom of the deck by Waveshaping are now shown
    - Even though the order in which they are put to the bottom of deck is random, so the information can be slightly incorrect
- ✨ Flag card destroyed by Ghost as "burned"
- ✨ Having Mothership in your deck will now cause the "Colossus damage" counter to appear
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Building-Block Glaive, Dr. Stitchensew, Mend the Timeline, Chronogor, Scrappy Scavenger when mousing over it in deck)
    - When the pool is too big, you will now see a message with the number of cards in the pool instead of the pool being hidden
- ✨ Update highlights (Ferocious Felbat, The Kingslayers, Ranger Initiate Vereesa, Chronogor)
- ✨ Update oracles (Interstellar Researcher, Sand Art Elemental, Royal Informant)
- ✨ Add Bwonsamdi's Boons to the Global Effects section
- ✨ Multiple triggers of Vereesa's effect will now get reflected in the Global Effects
