## Decktracker

- ✨ Firestone now lets you differentiate between cards drawn / created in the opponent hand
    - For cards where making this distinction matters, the order in which the card was added / created will be added next to the "gift" icon
    - You will now be able to see distinct dynamic pools for these cards
    - For instance: if the opponent plays Identity Theft, you will know which card was created from your hand and which one from your deck, and will be able to see all the possible options for each
- ✨ Relatedly, the tracker now shows Mini / Gigantic minions correctly even if the card creates additional cards on top of the Mini / Gigantic
- ✨ The Secrets Helper will now use the appropriate card pool in the Tavern Brawl (when applicable)
- ✨ Cards drawn by specific tutors (like "draw a spell") will now appear as "drawn by" on the tracker, instead of simply "unknown card"
- ✨ Update highlights (Lab Patron, Succumb to Madness, Firegill)
- ✨ Update oracles (Jumpscare, Shadowflame Suffusion)
- ✨ Update dynamic pools (Megafin, Botface, Vulpera Scoundrel)
- ✨ The Ysondre counter will stay visible after it being visible at least once
- 🐞 Fix an issue where the opponent's Protoss minion cost reduction counter would not always get reset using Warpgate and playing a Protoss minion
- 🐞 Fix an issue where secrets destroyed by Observer of Mysteries would not get removed from the "Board" zone
- 🐞 Fix an issue where Windfury being given to the hero would sometimes not correctly be reflected in the attack counter

## Arena

- 🐞 Fix an issue where the stats shown in the Draft overlay could be different from the ones shown in the Draft tracker
- 🐞 Fix an issue where card stats would not appear in the overlay when viewing the legendary package cards
- 🐞 Fix some issues with reverse highlights (eg mousing over a fire spell will highlight cards that interact with fire spells)
