## Settings

The Settings have been fully revamped. The new layout is still very much a work in progress, but will allow me to implement new settings faster, and to add much needed QoL features (see below). It will also make it easier for me to move settings around so that things make more sense.

What's planned next:

-   Add a search function to easily find the setting you want
-   Reorganize some sections
-   Add a few missing elements that I haven't yet migrated (like buttons to force refresh the packs and achievements)
