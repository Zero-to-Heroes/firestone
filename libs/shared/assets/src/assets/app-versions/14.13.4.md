## App

-   ✨ Add a setting to change the size of all widgets in the app globally
    -   I'm now trying to figure out a way to default this global setting based on the screen resolution in a way that doesn't mess up with everyone's existing setup :)
-   ✨ I have added buttons to import / export your current settings, which can be especially useful when changing computes
    -   They are under General > Data

## Dectracker

-   ✨ Add a new widget that shows the max health/mana if they changed this game
-   ✨ Add the deck's winrate to the "lobby" decklist that can you peruse before going into a game
-   ✨ Add card highlights (Funkfin, Wreck'em and Deck'em, Bob the Bartender)
-   🐞 Fix an issue where Photon Cannon's global effect was sometimes attributed to Artanis

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ In the combat simulator, the damage dealt will now show as a range
    -   At least 80% of cases should fall within that range
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the Naga spell counter was counting backwards
-   🐞 Fix further sim issues.
    -   The simulator now has a very decent level of accuracy. The main offenders today are boards with a combination of Scallywags and Bonerenders / Titus, because the number of pirate spawned does not always match what I would expect :)
