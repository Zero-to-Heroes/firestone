## General

-   ✨ The app's Main and Settings windows now fully close when you click on the "close" button. Previously, they would get hidden, but this led to unnecessary memory usage. Closing the app's main window with Alt + C still hides it.
-   I'm still addressing memory leaks in the app. It may take about a week to fix the biggest ones, so please be patient.

## Decktracker

-   ✨ Card highlights in the tracker can now show different conditions in different colors. Let me know if you encounter cards that could benefit from this feature!
-   ✨ Add a Dragons Summoned counter for the opponent, appearing only when they play Priest and summon at least one dragon.
-   ✨ Cards in the decklist will now be grouped based on whether the game considers them to be the same card (e.g., Core and non-Core versions).
-   🐞 Fix an issue where the Turn Timer and Attack Counter would stop working after playing an additional turn from Zarimi.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where importing a deck code in the deck builder would not properly import sideboards.

## Battlegrounds

-   ✨ The "gold next turn" counter now accounts for your board, including "start of next turn" effects like Accord-o-Tron.
-   🐞 Fix an issue where sometimes highlights would be off because Tavern Spells were ignored.
-   🐞 Fix an issue in the simulator UI where you couldn't remove the "summon mechs" enchantment once added.

## Arena

-   🐞 Fix an issue where the rewards would mention "Gold Cards" instead of normal cards.

## Achievements

-   🐞 Fix an issue where Firestone achievements could not be completed anymore.
