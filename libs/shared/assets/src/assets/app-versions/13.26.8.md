## App

-   ✨ The app has been updated for patch 30.4.3
-   ✨ On first launch after 13.26.8, the app will try to default the locale to your system locale.
    -   This is to help non-English speakers who can be struggling to get the app properly configured
    -   It will affect you if your Windows language is not the one you are using Firestone in, and you will need to change this in the Settings. Sorry for the inconvenience

## Settings

-   ✨ The left-side menu has been tweaked to better contrast category headers and clickable elements
